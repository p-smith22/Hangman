# Hangman
Required Python Package -- random -words
Download using pip install random-words

It's a basic hangman game. Choose the number of lives you have and guess words randomly generated by Python. It uses a package called
random words to generate random English words to guess. They are pretty difficult words, to be honest. The code forces them to be under 8
letters, so it limits the difficulty to an extent. The code will then prompt you to enter the number of lives you have, and lives will 
only be used if a letter is guessed that does not appear in the word. The game prevents false inputs and does not let you use a 
letter if you have previously used it in your guesses.
